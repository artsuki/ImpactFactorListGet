# ImpactFactorListGet
Get the impact factor of journals for researches from https://www.scijournal.org/

Can get the journal IF from that website theoretically,
since the site is without a uniform pattern, it is very difficult to get the content within one function

## suggestion:
It is better to put these codes into jupyter notebook, so that data could be used even if it crashes.
